                I come from the ghetto, so my trunk is in my hood
                She wouldn't wear no panties 'round me even if she could
                Gave out plenty spankings 'til they got it understood
                Fuck the nosebleeds, baby, come sit on this wood
                If you know it's tension, don't come 'round me like it's good
                I got street smarts and you can't get this out no book
                I can't right my wrongs, but I can still write these hooks
                Oh, time to get exposed
                You ain't been from 'round here, nigga, come get off your show
                Savage said you pussy and he hit it on the nose
                But that board is open, why you actin' like it's closed?

                The same way that I be goin' in and out of Texas
                Or in and out my sessions, or in and out her best friends
                Or in and out these courtrooms, my lawyer like, "Objection"
                Yeah, woah, woah
                All my bitches Spanish, boricua
                Water on my neck, these diamonds came with coral reefer
                She from overseas, I had to buy her a new visa
                Met your wife in Vegas, but I hit her in Ibiza
                She a supermodel, so she only eatin' Caesar
                Used to date a rapper, but he acted like a diva
                Niggas hustlin' backwards, out here ballin' with the reup
                Popped an Adderall, I feel like I can lift a tree up
                Seen too many cameras, so I never lift my ski up (Yeah)

                But you cannot pay your rent
                Got her rubbin' on my skin
                Sing to her like Boyz II Men
                Tired of her, give her to my friend
                Then I proceed to her twin (Okay)
